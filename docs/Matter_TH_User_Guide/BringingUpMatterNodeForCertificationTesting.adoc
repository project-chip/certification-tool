== *Bringing Up of Matter Node (DUT) for Certification Testing*

A Matter node can either be a commissioner, controller, controlee, software component or an application. The Matter SDK comes with a few example apps that can be used by Vendors as a reference to build their products. Refer to the examples folder in the https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip[SDK github repo] for the same.

DUT vendors need to get the device flashed with the production firmware revision that they want to get their device certified and execute all the applicable TC’s for their products using the TH. DUT vendors can skip the below sections as the TH brings up the reference applications automatically during the certification tests execution.

A hobby developer can build Matter reference apps either using a Raspberry Pi or Nordic DK board (if the user wants to use thread transport). Follow the instructions below for the <<bringing-up-of-reference-matter-node-dut-on-raspberry-pi, Raspberry Pi>> and <<bringing-up-of-reference-matter-node-dut-on-thread-platform, Nordic>> platforms. 

=== Bringing Up of Reference Matter Node (DUT) on Raspberry Pi

In the case where a device maker/hobby developer needs to bring up a sample/reference DUT, i.e. light bulb, door lock, etc. using the example apps provided in SDK and verify provisioning of the DUT over the Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces, follow the below steps to set up the DUT.

Users can either use the example apps (i.e. light bulb, door lock, etc.) that are shipped with the TH image OR build the apps from the latest SDK source. 

To use the apps that are shipped with the TH image, follow the instructions below:

* Flash the TH image on the Raspberry Pi. 
* Go to the apps folder in /home/ubuntu/apps (as shown below) and launch the app that the user is interested in.

To build the example apps from the latest SDK source, follow the instructions below: 

* User to acquire Raspberry Pi Version 4 with SD card of minimum 64 Gb memory.
* Flash the TH image on to the SDK card that will be inserted into the Raspberry Pi as the TH image comes with the default Ubuntu OS image OR the user can download the latest Ubuntu LTS image and install all the required dependencies as outlined in https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/BUILDING.md[https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/BUILDING.md].
* Clone the connected home SDK repo using the following commands:


|===
|*$* `git clone pass:[git@github.com:project-chip/connectedhomeip.git] --recursive` +
*$* `cd connectedhome` +
*$* `source scripts/bootstrap.sh` +
*$* `source scripts/activate.sh`  
|===


* Select the sample app that the user wants to build as available in the examples folder of the SDK repo e.g., lighting-app, all-cluster-app. The user needs to build these apps for the Linux platform using the following command:

|===
|Build the app using the below command:

`./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/all-clusters-app/linux/examples/all-clusters-app/linux/out/all-clusters-app chip_inet_config_enable_ipv4=false`
|===


==== To Provision Raspberry Pi Using Wi-Fi Configuration

The sample app (lighting-app or lock-app or all-cluster-app) can be provisioned over the Wi-Fi network when the app is launched with the “--wifi” argument.

|===
|`./chip-all-clusters-app --wifi`
|===


==== To Provision Raspberry Pi Over Ethernet Configuration

The sample app (lighting-app or lock-app or all-cluster-app) can be provisioned over the Ethernet (using onnetwork configuration) that it is connected when the app is launched with no arguments.


|===
|`./chip-all-clusters-app`
|===


=== Bringing Up of Reference Matter Node (DUT) on Thread Platform

Follow the instructions below to set up the Matter Node on Thread Platform. For additional reference, go to the following link:
