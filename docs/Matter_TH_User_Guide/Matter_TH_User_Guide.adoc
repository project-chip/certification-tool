== *Introduction*

The Matter Test-Harness is a comprehensive test tool used for certification testing of Matter devices in accordance with the Matter protocol as defined in the https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document/folder/2269[Matter specification]. 

This user guide serves as the primary user documentation to work with the Test-Harness ( *TH* ) tool, providing high-level architecture of the tool, how to use the tool to execute certification tests and submit the test results to CSA for certification.

The TH tool runs on the Raspberry Pi platform, providing an intuitive Web user interface to create a test project, configure the project/Device Under Test ( *DUT* ) settings, load the required test cases using the PICS xml file and execute test cases for various devices (commissioner, controller and controlee) as defined in the Matter specification. 

The TH tool provides an option to execute the following test scripts— Automated, Semi Automated, Python, Manual and Simulated. Upon completion of the test execution, detailed logs and test results will be available for user analysis. The user will also be able to submit logs to ATL’s for review to obtain device certification.

The TH tool can be used by any DUT vendor to run the Matter certification tests OR by any hobby developer to get acquainted with the Matter certification testing tools or technologies.

== *Test-Harness (TH) Design*

This section outlines the TH architecture, data model and data flow on how different components of TH communicate with each other.

=== TH Layout
.The Test-Harness Layout
image::images/img_0.png[TH Layout]


Each of the main subsystems of the Test Harness (Proxy, Frontend, Backend and Database) runs on its own docker container deployed to a Ubuntu Raspberry Pi platform. The Proxy container hosts an instance of the traefik application proxy (https://traefik.io/traefik/[https://traefik.io/traefik/]) which is responsible to route user requests coming from an external (to the Raspberry Pi) web browser to either the Frontend or the Backend as appropriate. The Frontend container serves the dynamic web pages that comprise the Web GUI to be rendered on the user browser including the client-side logic. According to that client-side logic and user input, REST API requests are sent again by the external browser to the Application Proxy and get redirected to the Backend container, where a FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/]) Python application implements the server-side logic. Any application information that needs to be persisted gets serialized and written by the server-side logic to the Postgres database running in the Database container.

In addition to the four main containers described above, which get created and destroyed when the Raspberry Pi platform respectively boots up and shuts down, two other containers are created and destroyed dynamically on demand according to the test execution lifecycle: the SDK container and the OTBR container. The SDK container has copies of the Matter SDK tools (binary executables) which can be used to play the role of clients and servers of the Matter protocol in test interactions, either as Test Harness actuators or DUT simulators. That container gets automatically created and destroyed by the server-side logic at the start and at the end, respectively, of a Test Suite which needs actuators or simulators. The OTBR container, on the other hand, hosts an instance of the Open Thread Border Router and needs to be explicitly started by the TH user when they want to test a real Matter device that runs over a Thread fabric, as described in <<ot-border-router-otbr-setup, Section 7, OT Border Router (OTBR) Setup>>.



=== Data Model

<<<
== *Getting Started with Matter Test-Harness (TH)*

The Matter Node (DUT) that is used for certification testing can either be a commissioner, controller or controlee. 

If the DUT is a controlee (e.g., light bulb), the TH spins a reference commissioner/controller using chip-tool binary shipped with the SDK. The TH commissioner provisions the DUT and is used to execute the certification tests on the controlee. 

If the DUT is a commissioner/controller, the Test TH spins an example accessory that is shipped with the SDK and uses that for the DUT to provision, control and run certification tests.

Refer to <<bringing-up-of-matter-node-dut-for-certification-testing, Section 5, Bringing Up of Matter Node (DUT) for Certification Testing>> to bring up the DUT and then proceed with device testing by referring to <<test-configuration, Section 8, Test Configuration>>.

For hobby developers who want to get acquainted with certification tools/process/TC’s, can spin DUT’s using the example apps provided in the SDK. Refer to the instructions to set up one https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/matter-csg/document/folder/2756[here].

TH runs on Ubuntu 22.04 Server LTS. The official installation method uses a Raspberry Pi (<<th-image-installation-on-raspberry-pi>>), but there's an alternative method used in the tool's development that uses a virtual machine instead (<<th-installation-without-a-raspberry-pi>>). Keep in mind that thread networking is not officially supported in VM installations at the moment.

=== TH Installation on Raspberry Pi

There are two ways to obtain the latest TH on Raspberry Pi. Follow the instructions in <<th-installation-on-raspberry-pi, Section 4.1.2, TH Installation on Raspberry Pi>> to install TH from scratch OR if you already have the TH, follow the instructions in <<update-existing-th, Section 4.4, Update Existing TH>> to update the TH.

==== *Prerequisites*

The following equipment will be required to have a complete TH setup:

* *Raspberry Pi Version 4 with SD card of minimum 64 GB Memory*

The TH will be installed on Raspberry PI. The TH contains couple of docker container(s) with all the required dependencies for certification tests execution.

* *Windows or Linux System (Laptop/Desktop/Mac)*

The Mac/PC will be used to flash the Ubuntu image on the SD card to be used on Raspberry Pi. Download the https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi Imager] or https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Balena Etcher] tool. The same can be used to set up the required build environment for the Matter SDK or building Matter reference apps for various platforms. 

* *RCP dongle*

If the DUT supports thread transport, an RCP dongle provisioned with a recommended RCP firmware for the default OTBR router that comes with the TH will be required to function properly. Currently, the OTBR can work with a Nordic RCP dongle or a SiLabs RCP dongle. Refer to <<ot-border-router-otbr-setup, Section 6, OT Border Router (OTBR) Setup>> on how to install the RCP firmware.

==== TH Installation on Raspberry Pi

. Place the blank SD card into the user’s system USB slot. 
. Open the https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi Imager] or https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Balena Etcher] tool on the Mac/PC and select the 'Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (64-bit)'.
* Edit the SO custom settings to: 
** username: ubuntu
** password: raspberrypi
** hostname: ubuntu
* Make sure you have enabled the SSH service.
. After the SD card has been flashed, remove the SD card and place it in the Raspberry Pi’s memory card slot.
. Power on the Raspberry Pi and ensure that the local area network, display monitor and keyboard are connected.
. Enter the username and password.
. Install the TH system:
* Clone the TH repository: 
** `$git clone -b <Target_Branch/Tag> https://github.com/project-chip/certification-tool.git`
* Goto to TH folder: 
** `$cd certification-tool`
* Initialize the submodules: 
** `$git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Install/configure the TH dependencies: 
** `$./scripts/pi-setup/auto-install.sh`
** At the end of the script, select option 1 to restart the RaspberryPi.
. Wait about 10 minutes. 
. Using the _ifconfig_ command, obtain the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. The same IP address will be used to launch the TH user interface on the user's system using the browser.
. Proceed with test configuration and execution (refer to <<test-configuration, Section 8, Test Configuration>> and <<test-case-execution, Section 9, Test Case Execution>> respectively).


=== Troubleshooting

==== Read-Only File System Error
* During the execution of the above commands if a read-only file system error or an error showing "Is docker daemon running?" occurs, follow the steps below to fix the issue:

|===
|`$sudo fsck` ( Press 'y' for fixing all the errors )   
|===


* Upon successful completion, try the following commands:

|===
|`$sudo reboot` +
ssh back into the TH IP address using: +
`$ssh ubuntu@<IPADDRESS-OF-THE-RASPI>`
|===


* In case “sudo fsck” fails, use the following commands:

|===
|`sudo fsck -y -f /dev/mmcblk0p2` +
`fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p2`
|===


* In case the “remote: Repository not found” fatal error occurs, try the following steps to fix the issue. Clone the certification-tool with personal access token (Refer to <<generate-personal-access-token, Section 4.2.2, Generate Personal Access Token>> to generate the personal access token) and follow the steps below.

|===
|cd ~ +

Take the backup of Test Harness binary using below command: +
`$mv certification-tool certification-tool-backup` +
`$git clone https://<token>@github.com/project-chip/certification-tool.git`

Follow the instructions given in the section below on how to <<update-existing-th, update an existing Test-Harness>>
|===


==== Generate Personal Access Token

The Personal Access Token may be required during the process of updating an existing TH image. Below are the instructions to obtain the personal access token.

. Connect to the Github account (the one recognized and authorized by Matter).
. On the upper-right corner of the page, click on the profile photo, then click on *Settings*.
. On the left sidebar, click on *Developer settings*.
. On the left sidebar, click on *Personal access tokens* [Personal access tokens (classic)].
. Click on *Generate new token* .
. Provide a descriptive name for the token.
. Enter an expiration date, in days or using the calendar. 
. Select the scopes or permissions to grant this token.
. Click on *Generate new token* .
. The generated token will be printed out on the screen. Make sure to save it as a local copy as it will disappear.
+
NOTE: Sample token: pass:[ghp_hUQExoppLKma***************Urg4P]

==== Bringing Up of Docker Containers Manually

During the initial reboot of the Raspberry Pi, if the docker is not initiated automatically, try the following command on the Raspberry Pi terminal to bring up the dockers.

|===
|Use the command `ssh ubuntu@IP_address` from the PC to log in to Raspberry Pi. Refer above sections on how to obtain the IP address of Raspberry Pi.

Once the SSH connection is successful, start the docker container using the command +
*$* `./certification-tool/scripts/start.sh`

The above command might take a while to get executed, wait for 5-10 minutes and then proceed with the Test Execution Steps as outlined in the below sections.  
|===

=== TH installation without a Raspberry Pi

The official installation method uses a Raspberry Pi (<<th-image-installation-on-raspberry-pi>>). **This alternative installation method is targeted for development purpose and it only supports onnetwork pairing mode.**

To install TH without using a Raspberry Pi you'll need a machine with Ubuntu 22.04 Server LTS. You can <<create-an-ubuntu-virtual-machine, create a virtual machine>> for this purpose, but be aware that if the host's architecture is not arm64 you'll need to <<substitute-the-sdks-docker-image-and-update-sample-apps, substitute the SDK's docker image>> in order for it to work properly.

==== Create an Ubuntu virtual machine

Here's an example of how to create a virtual machine for TH using multipass (https://multipass.run/).

* Install multipass

|===
|`brew install multipass`
|===

* Create new VM with Ubuntu 22.04 (2 cpu cores, 8G mem and a 50G disk)

|===
|`multipass launch 22.04 -n matter-vm -c 2 -m 8G -d 50G`
|===

* SSH into VM

|===
|`multipass shell matter-vm`
|===

NOTE: About Multipass: +
Seems like bridged network is not available, so you will not be able to test with DUT outside the docker container, but you can develop using the sample apps on the platform.

==== Setup TH in Ubuntu

* Create new ssh key

|===
|`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "user@matter-vm"`
|===

* Add SSH key to GitHub Settings

* Clone git repo

|===
|`git clone git@github.com:project-chip/certification-tool.git"`
|===

* Go into the repo directory

|===
|`cd certification-tool`
|===

* Run TH auto install script

|===
|`./scripts/ubuntu/auto-install.sh`
|===

* Reboot VM

If using multipass, to find the IP address use the command

|===
|`multipass list`
|===

==== Substitute the SDK's docker image and update sample apps

In order to run TH in a machine that uses the 'linux/amd64' platform, you'll need to first build a new SDK docker image.

* Get the SDK commit SHA

|===
|Value for variable `SDK_DOCKER_TAG` in TH repository path `certification-tool/backend/app/core/config.py`
|===

* Download the Dockerfile for chip-cert-bins from the commit you need

|===
|Substitute <COMMIT_SHA> with the value from `SDK_DOCKER_TAG`: +
`github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/<COMMIT_SHA>/integrations/docker/images/chip-cert-bins/Dockerfile`
|===

* Copy Docker file to TH's machine

* Make sure that no other SDK image for that commit SHA is loaded in the machine

|===
|Run `docker images` +
If there's an image with a tag for the commit you're using, delete that image +
`docker image rm <IMAGE_ID>`
|===

* Build new SDK image (this could take about 3 hours)

|===
|Substitute <COMMIT_SHA> with the value from `SDK_DOCKER_TAG`: +
`docker buildx build --load --build-arg COMMITHASH=<COMMIT_SHA> --tag connectedhomeip/chip-cert-bins:<COMMIT_SHA> .`
|===

* Update TH sample apps

|===
|To update your sample apps using the new image, you should first edit the `certification-tool/scripts/ubuntu/update-sample-apps.sh` script to comment out or remove the following line: +
`sudo docker pull $SDK_DOCKER_IMAGE:$SDK_DOCKER_TAG` +
This is needed because the docker pull command downloads the image from the remote. Removing this line, the script will use your local image. +
Then run this script in the certification-tool repository +
`./scripts/ubuntu/update-sample-apps.sh`
|===


=== Update Existing TH

To update an existing TH environment, follow the instructions below on the terminal.

|===
|`cd ~/certification-tool` +
`git fetch` +
`git checkout <Target_Branch/Tag>` +
`git pull` +
`git submodule update --init --recursive` +
`./scripts/ubuntu/auto-update.sh <Target_Branch/Tag>` +
`./scripts/start.sh` +

Wait for 10 mins and open the TH application using the browser
|===

=== Updating Existing Yaml Test Script

It is possible to update yaml test script content by directly editing the file content. It is useful when validating small changes or fixing misspelled commands.

Yaml files are located at:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/yaml_tests/yaml/sdk/`
|===

To update an existing Yaml test script: (e.g. `Test_TC_ACE_1_1.yaml`)

* Open the script file:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/yaml_tests/yaml/sdk/Test_TC_ACE_1_1.yaml`
|===

* Update/change the desired information.

* Save and close the file.

* Restart TH's backend container:
|===
|`$docker restart certification-tool_backend_1`
|===

* Changes will be available on the next execution of the yaml test.

To create a new Yaml test script:

* Use an existing test script as a starting point.

* Rename the file to a new one: e.g. `Test_TC_ACE_1_1.yaml` to `Test_TC_ACE_9_9.yaml`

* Update the name entry inside the yaml file:

|===
|**FROM** name: 42.1.1. `[TC-ACE-1.1]` Privileges

**TO** name: 42.1.1. `[TC-ACE-9.9]` Privileges
|===

* Proceed as explained on updating an existent yaml file.


=== Customized Test Scripts (Yaml/Python Tests)

To use customized tests, the files must be placed in the specific folder (described below). This way, Test-Harness will load and display the available tests on the interface.
These tests will not be affected if the system is restarted or if the SDK Yaml tests are updated.

Custom Yaml files folder are located at:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/yaml_tests/yaml/custom/`
|===

Custom Python files folder are located at:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/python_testing/scripts/custom/`
|===

.Test-Harness displaying the custom tests.

== *Bringing Up of Matter Node (DUT) for Certification Testing*

A Matter node can either be a commissioner, controller, controlee, software component or an application. The Matter SDK comes with a few example apps that can be used by Vendors as a reference to build their products. Refer to the examples folder in the https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip[SDK github repo] for the same.

DUT vendors need to get the device flashed with the production firmware revision that they want to get their device certified and execute all the applicable TC’s for their products using the TH. DUT vendors can skip the below sections as the TH brings up the reference applications automatically during the certification tests execution.

A hobby developer can build Matter reference apps either using a Raspberry Pi or Nordic DK board (if the user wants to use thread transport). Follow the instructions below for the <<bringing-up-of-reference-matter-node-dut-on-raspberry-pi, Raspberry Pi>> and <<bringing-up-of-reference-matter-node-dut-on-thread-platform, Nordic>> platforms. 

=== Bringing Up of Reference Matter Node (DUT) on Raspberry Pi

In the case where a device maker/hobby developer needs to bring up a sample/reference DUT, i.e. light bulb, door lock, etc. using the example apps provided in SDK and verify provisioning of the DUT over the Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces, follow the below steps to set up the DUT.

Users can either use the example apps (i.e. light bulb, door lock, etc.) that are shipped with the TH image OR build the apps from the latest SDK source. 

To use the apps that are shipped with the TH image, follow the instructions below:

* Flash the TH image on the Raspberry Pi. 
* Go to the apps folder in /home/ubuntu/apps (as shown below) and launch the app that the user is interested in.

image:images/img_3.png[]

To build the example apps from the latest SDK source, follow the instructions below: 

* User to acquire Raspberry Pi Version 4 with SD card of minimum 64 Gb memory.
* Flash the TH image on to the SDK card that will be inserted into the Raspberry Pi as the TH image comes with the default Ubuntu OS image OR the user can download the latest Ubuntu LTS image and install all the required dependencies as outlined in https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/BUILDING.md[https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/BUILDING.md].
* Clone the connected home SDK repo using the following commands:


|===
|*$* `git clone pass:[git@github.com:project-chip/connectedhomeip.git] --recursive` +
*$* `cd connectedhome` +
*$* `source scripts/bootstrap.sh` +
*$* `source scripts/activate.sh`  
|===


* Select the sample app that the user wants to build as available in the examples folder of the SDK repo e.g., lighting-app, all-cluster-app. The user needs to build these apps for the Linux platform using the following command:

|===
|Build the app using the below command:

`./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/all-clusters-app/linux/examples/all-clusters-app/linux/out/all-clusters-app chip_inet_config_enable_ipv4=false`
|===


==== To Provision Raspberry Pi Using Wi-Fi Configuration

The sample app (lighting-app or lock-app or all-cluster-app) can be provisioned over the Wi-Fi network when the app is launched with the “--wifi” argument.

|===
|`./chip-all-clusters-app --wifi`
|===


==== To Provision Raspberry Pi Over Ethernet Configuration

The sample app (lighting-app or lock-app or all-cluster-app) can be provisioned over the Ethernet (using onnetwork configuration) that it is connected when the app is launched with no arguments.

== *Test Configuration*

=== Project Configuration

When the DUT is a client, refer to <<simulated-tests>>. The TH brings up the example accessory using chip-app1 binary. The user will be prompted to commission the device. Once the commissioning process is completed, proceed with the test execution.

In the case where the DUT is a server, the TH spins up the controller, the DUT bring-up procedure should be completed and has to be paired with the controller. 

Depending on the DUT’s network transport, any one of the appropriate pairing modes can be opted:

* *‘ble-wifi* ’ to complete the pairing for the DUT using BLE Wi-Fi 
* *‘onnetwork’* to complete the pairing for the DUT that is already on the operational network (e.g., the device is already present on the same Ethernet network of the TH) connection
* *‘ble-thread’* to complete the pairing for the Thread Device

Follow the sections below for the project configuration and test execution.

==== Projects Menu
. Open a Web browser from the user's system and enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi as given in <<th-installation-on-raspberry-pi, Section 4.1.2, TH Installation on Raspberry Pi>>. 
. In case the TH user interface does not launch, refer to <<bringing-up-of-docker-containers-manually, Section 4.2.3, Bringing Up of Docker Containers Manually>>.

== *Test Case Execution*

Refer to <<references, Section 2, References>> for PICS tool documentation to generate the PICS XML files.

PICS (_Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement_) is a list of features supported by a device as defined by a technology _protocol_ , standard or specification. Each feature is known as a _PICS Item_ , and device _implementation_ is either mandatory or optional. PICS is used by the device manufacturer as a _statement_ of _conformance to_ a technology standard and a requirement for all CSA Product Certification programs.

PICS codes are generated from the Test Plans. The Base.xml file lists all the Core feature PICS from the Matter Base Specifications and the application cluster PICS are listed in the respective TestPlan.xml files. Follow the steps below to generate and upload the PICS files.

. Click on the following link to download the PICS XML files— https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/matter-csg/document/26122[https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/matter-csg/document/26122]
. Click on the following link to use the PICS tool— https://picstool.csa-iot.org/#userguide[PICS Tool v1.6.4 matter 1.0 - Connectivity Standards Alliance (csa-iot.org)]
. Load the Base.xml file by clicking on the *Browse* option. In case the following error is observed:
+
WARNING: *Base.xml: This XML PICS template is unapproved and has not been tested with this tool. To test new or updated PICS documents, please enable _author mode_ and try again.*
+
Enable author mode and retry uploading the XML file.
+
image:images/img_31.png[]

. Load the XML file that is required for testing, e.g., Doorlock.xml.
. Check the option for which the testing will be done for the DoorLock cluster. In the case of the Door Lock cluster to be tested in the Server mode, select the checkbox for DRLK.S. In case the cluster has to be tested in the Client mode, select the checkbox for DRLK.C.
+
image:images/img_56.png[]

. Review all the attributes/commands that are supported by the DoorLock cluster and ensure the corresponding options are checked in the PICS tool.
. Click on *Validate PICS* . Ensure that there are no warnings or errors. In case of any warnings or errors, revisit the options and check/uncheck the options as supported by the DUT.
+
image:images/img_32.png[]

. Prior to the test execution, the user will have to load the relevant PICS file to list the required test cases. Depending on the PICS file loaded, the test suites list will be updated accordingly.
+
image:images/img_33.png[]

=== Automated and Semi Automated Tests

==== Automated Test Cases

Click on the *SDK YAML Tests* tab. The automated and semi automated test cases will be listed in **FirstChipToolSuite**. The Automated test cases will be listed as the TC-<Cluster>-XX without any suffix, e.g., TC-DRLK-1.1. Automated test case execution will not require any manual intervention.

==== Semi Automated Test Cases

The Semi Automated test cases will be listed as TC-<Cluster>-XX(Semi-automated). During the Semi Automated test case execution, some of the steps will be executed automatically and the user will be prompted to perform a few steps as shown below in the screenshots. From the TH user interface, load the required PICS file to select the test cases, e.g., Doorlock Test Plan.xml.

Select the required Semi Automated test case to be executed and ensure other test cases are not selected. Take for example TC-ACE-1.6 as shown below:

image:images/img_34.png[]

Bring up the DUT (All Clusters as Server) by sending the following command `./chip-all-clusters-app` on the Raspberry Pi terminal and click on the *Start* button.

During the Test execution, as the log gets updated, copy the newly generated node ID.

image:images/img_35.png[]

Form the Chip-tool, execute the above command with node ID listed in the TH log. Save the Chip-tool logs in a text file. Verify the result in the Chip-tool log and select the applicable choice from the user prompt in the TH tool and select the *Submit* button.


|===
|Example: +
`docker exec -it th-chip-tool <popup command> <newly generated nodeID> <end-point id>`

`cd apps` +
`docker exec -it th-chip-tool ./chip-tool groups view-group 0x0105 Oxb1d2ee23dcf2f18b 0`
|===


Check for the response of the command in the Chip-tool log and compare with the expected response from the TH user prompt as shown below. In case both the responses match, click on *PASS* followed by the *Submit* button.

image:images/img_36.png[]

At the end of the test execution, the user will be prompted to upload the Chip-tool logs that were saved in the previous step.

=== Python Tests

The Onboarding Payload Device Discovery test cases are listed under this option. Before executing the Python tests, bring up the DUT in the Chip-tool and save the discovery log. During the Python test execution, the user is prompted to input data such as QR code. Copy the data from the previously saved logs and provide the input. Follow the sequence below to execute the python_tests.

During the DUT bring-up, note down the QR code and save it for future use.

image:images/img_37.png[]

Select the python_tests tab for the test execution.

image:images/img_38.png[]

During the test execution the user is prompted for the QR code. Use the code that was saved earlier and proceed with the testing.

image:images/img_39.png[]

=== Manual Tests

During the manual test case execution, the user is prompted for an action for each test step as shown below.

image:images/img_40.png[]

After the Manual pairing of the DUT, execute the command displayed on the prompt as shown below.

|===
|Example:  `./apps/chip-tool doorlock read-event door_lock-alarm 1 1`
|===

Save the Chip-tool logs in a text file. Validate the chip tool log and select the applicable choice from the user prompt in the TH tool and select the *Submit* button. At the end of the test execution, the user is prompted to upload the Chip-tool logs that were saved in the previous step.

=== Simulated Tests

Simulated tests must be executed when the DUT is considered as a Client. The simulated test cases will be listed in **FirstAppSuite** under the *SDK YAML Tests* tab.

image:images/img_59.png[]

During the execution of these tests, the user is prompted for an action to be performed on the device as shown in the following screenshot.

Follow the instructions provided in the user prompt to complete the test execution.

image:images/img_41.png[]

|===
|IMPORTANT: Currently the selection will be done automatically by TH based on the test execution result. In the future the User Prompt will be updated to proper represent this behavior.
|===

=== SDK Python Tests

==== Run Tests Inside SDK Docker Container

Some automated Python scripts are available inside the docker of the TH image.

E.g.: TC_ACE_1_3.py, TC_ACE_1_4.py , TC_CGEN_2_4.py , TC_DA_1_7.py , TC_RR_1_1.py  TC_SC_3_6.py

Follow the instructions below to execute the test cases.

===== Prerequisite

. A directory containing the PAA (Product) roots that will be mounted as /paa_roots.
. Run the following commands from the Raspberry Pi terminal.

+
|===
|`cd certification-tool` +
`./scripts/ubuntu/update-paa-certs.sh`
|===

. After execution of the above commands ensure that the PAA’s are available locally at */var/paa-root-certs* .

===== Placeholders for Steps

Device-specific configuration is shown as shell variables. *PLEASE REPLACE THOSE WITH THE CORRECT VALUE* in the steps below.

* *$PATH_TO_PAA_ROOTS*: Path on host where PAA roots are located. Failure to provide a correct path will cause early failure during commissioning (e.g., /var/paa-root-certs/)
* *$DISCRIMINATOR*: Long discriminator for DUT (e.g., 3840 for Linux examples)
* *$SETUP_PASSCODE*: Setup passcode for DUT (e.g., 20202021 for Linux examples)
* *$WIFI_SSID*: SSID of Wi-Fi AP to which to attempt connection
* *$WIFI_PASSPHRASE*: Passphrase of Wi-Fi AP to which to attempt connection
* *$BLE_INTERFACE_ID*: Interface ID for BLE interface (e.g., 0 for default, which usually works)
* *$THREAD_DATASET_HEX*: Thread operational dataset as a hex string (e.g., output of dataset active -x in OpenThread CLI on an existing end-device

===== Common Steps

|===
|Factory-reset the DUT

`docker run -v $PATH_TO_PAA_ROOTS:/paa_roots -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -v $(pwd):/launch_dir --privileged --network host -it connectedhomeip/chip-cert-bins:<SDK SHA RECOMMENDED>`
|===

This downloads a Docker image with the test environment, and runs the environment including mounting the PAA trust store in */paa_roots* and mounts the local Avahi socket so that Avahi in the VM can run against its host.

* You will be shown a *#* root prompt

NOTE: *The first time running docker will be SLOW (around 5 minutes) due to the need to download data. Every other run after that will be instant.*

===== For On-Network Pairing

Execute the following command:

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/TC_RR_1_1.py --discriminator $DISCRIMINATOR --passcode $SETUP_PASSCODE --commissioning-method on-network --paa-trust-store-path /paa_roots --storage-path admin_storage.json`
|===

To test this against a Linux target running on the same network as the host:

|===
|`clear && rm -f kvs1 && ./chip-all-clusters-app --discriminator 3842 --KVS kvs1 --trace_decode 1`
|===


[NOTE]
==== 
* The $DISCRIMINATOR to be used will be 3842 in this example.
* The *rm -f kvs1* is a factory reset.
====

===== For BLE+Wi-Fi Pairing

Execute the following command in the docker for the BLE+Wi-Fi pairing:

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/TC_RR_1_1.py --discriminator $DISCRIMINATOR --passcode $SETUP_PASSCODE --commissioning-method ble-wifi --paa-trust-store-path /paa_roots --storage-path admin_storage.json --wifi-ssid $WIFI_SSID --wifi-passphrase $WIFI_PASSPHRASE --ble-interface-id $BLE_INTERFACE_ID`
|===

===== For BLE+Thread Pairing

Execute the below command in the docker for the BLE+Thread pairing:

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/TC_RR_1_1.py --discriminator $DISCRIMINATOR --passcode $SETUP_PASSCODE --commissioning-method ble-thread --paa-trust-store-path /paa_roots --storage-path admin_storage.json --thread-dataset-hex $THREAD_DATASET_HEX --ble-interface-id $BLE_INTERFACE_ID`
|===


===== Post-Test Steps

Factory reset the DUT again → The test fills tons of stuff and the device will be in an odd state of ACL’s. This will be fixed once there is ample time to clean up after the test is completed by sending commands to, for example, remove the fabrics joined.

===== Possible Issues

* Failing at Step 9 during execution of TC_RR_1_1:
.. Some DUT’s have an incorrectly-configured UserLabel cluster where the backend is not implemented due to SDK example issues where some examples have the backend and others do not. This will fail at the last step (“Step 9: Fill UserLabel clusters on each endpoint”), with FAILURE writes. To override the test not to run this step, you can add “*--bool-arg skip_user_label_cluster_steps:true*“ to the command line of *TC_RR_1_1.py*, at the end.
.. Not having the *$PATH_TO_PAA_ROOTS* set properly when starting the docker or not having PAA roots certificates at that path.
.. Follow the instructions for item 2 in <<prerequisite, Section 9.5.1.1, Prerequisite>>.

====== Common Test Failures

The documents in this https://github.com/project-chip/matter-test-scripts/tree/main/docs/common_test_failures[link] are intended to be used to help root-cause common test failures, especially in cases where the underlying cause of the failure may not be immediately obvious from the test step or expected outcomes.

==== Run Tests on the TH User Interface

Some automated Python scripts are available in TH User Interface.

To execute the tests, the parameters *discriminator*, *setup_code* and *pairing_mode* need to be filled in the device configuration parameters (*dut_config*).

To configure specific/custom parameters, please edit the project configuration to include the parameters in the session (*test_parameters*).

Project configuration example:
[source,xml,options="unbreakable"]
----
{
  ...
  "dut_config": {
    "discriminator": "3840",
    "setup_code": "20202021",
    "pairing_mode": "onnetwork",
    "chip_tool_timeout": null,
    "chip_tool_use_paa_certs": false
  },
  "test_parameters": {
    "paa-trust-store-path": "/credentials/development/paa_roots",
    "storage-path": "admin_storage.json"
  }
  ...
}
----

===== Test suites

TH expects the SDK Python Tests to follow a certain template. New tests are being written with this template and the old tests are being updated to conform to it. The tests are divided in 3 test suites:

image:images/img_61.png[SDK Python Tests - Suites]

. Python Testing Suite
  * For test cases that follow the expected template and have a commissioning first step.
  * The user will be asked to make sure that the DUT is in Commissioning Mode at the start of the test suite setup and then the DUT will be commissioned.
  * The commissioning will be kept throughout the execution of all its tests.
. Python Testing Suite - No commissioning
  * For test cases that follow the expected template but don't have a commissioning first step.
  * The selected tests will be executed without commissioning the DUT.
  * The user will be asked to make sure that the DUT is in Commissioning Mode at the start of each test.
. Python Testing Suite - Legacy
  * For test cases that don't follow the expected template yet.
  * The user will be asked to make sure that the DUT is in Commissioning Mode at the start of each test.
  * The user will also be asked if the DUT should be commissioned at the start of each test. The DUT will be commissioned depending on the user's answer.

image:images/img_62.png[SDK Python Tests - Commissioning Mode prompt]

image:images/img_63.png[SDK Python Tests - DUT should be commissioned prompt]

===== PIXIT Support

PIXIT type parameters must be filled in the *test_parameters* section.
The following example will be used to define the following parameters:

----
PIXIT.ACE.APPENDPOINT:1
PIXIT.ACE.APPDEVTYPEID:256
PIXIT.ACE.APPCLUSTER:OnOff
PIXIT.ACE.APPATTRIBUTE:OnOff
----

Project configuration example:
[source,xml,options="unbreakable"]
----
{
  ...
  "test_parameters": {
    "paa-trust-store-path": "/credentials/development/paa_roots",
    "storage-path": "admin_storage.json",
    "int-arg": "PIXIT.ACE.APPENDPOINT:1 PIXIT.ACE.APPDEVTYPEID:256",
    "string-arg": "PIXIT.ACE.APPCLUSTER:OnOff PIXIT.ACE.APPATTRIBUTE:OnOff"
  }
  ...
}
----

The above example will be used to define the following arguments when running the test:

----
--int-arg PIXIT.ACE.APPENDPOINT:1 PIXIT.ACE.APPDEVTYPEID:256 --string-arg PIXIT.ACE.APPCLUSTER:OnOff PIXIT.ACE.APPATTRIBUTE:OnOff
----


<<<
== *Collect Logs and Submit to TEDS*

DUT’s that require certification from CSA, need to submit the results to CSA’s TEDS portal for ATL’s to review the test results. 

Any hobby developer that is executing these tests using TH need not submit results to TEDS. 

=== Instructions to Download Test Results

==== From the TH User Interface

After completing the test case execution, the user has two options to download the test logs and test reports.

From the Test Execution page, you can download reports and logs as shown below.
