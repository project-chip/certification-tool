== *Introduction*

The Matter Test-Harness is a comprehensive test tool used for certification testing of Matter devices in accordance with the Matter protocol as defined in the https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document/folder/2269[Matter specification]. 

This user guide serves as the primary user documentation to work with the Test-Harness ( *TH* ) tool, providing high-level architecture of the tool, how to use the tool to execute certification tests and submit the test results to CSA for certification.

The TH tool runs on the Raspberry Pi platform, providing an intuitive Web user interface to create a test project, configure the project/Device Under Test ( *DUT* ) settings, load the required test cases using the PICS xml file and execute test cases for various devices (commissioner, controller and controlee) as defined in the Matter specification. 

The TH tool provides an option to execute the following test scripts— Automated, Semi Automated, Python, Manual and Simulated. Upon completion of the test execution, detailed logs and test results will be available for user analysis. The user will also be able to submit logs to ATL’s for review to obtain device certification.

The TH tool can be used by any DUT vendor to run the Matter certification tests, or by any hobby developer to get acquainted with the Matter certification testing tools or technologies.

== *Test-Harness (TH) Design*

This section outlines the TH architecture, data model and data flow on how different components of TH communicate with each other.

=== TH Layout
.The Test-Harness Layout
image::images/img_0.png[TH Layout]


Each of the main subsystems of the Test Harness (Proxy, Frontend, Backend and Database) runs on its own docker container deployed to a Ubuntu Raspberry Pi platform. The Proxy container hosts an instance of the traefik application proxy (https://traefik.io/traefik/[https://traefik.io/traefik/]) which is responsible to route user requests coming from an external (to the Raspberry Pi) web browser to either the Frontend or the Backend as appropriate. The Frontend container serves the dynamic web pages that comprise the Web GUI to be rendered on the user browser including the client-side logic. According to that client-side logic and user input, REST API requests are sent again by the external browser to the Application Proxy and get redirected to the Backend container, where a FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/]) Python application implements the server-side logic. Any application information that needs to be persisted gets serialized and written by the server-side logic to the Postgres database running in the Database container.

In addition to the four main containers described above, which get created and destroyed when the Raspberry Pi platform respectively boots up and shuts down, two other containers are created and destroyed dynamically on demand according to the test execution lifecycle: the SDK container and the OTBR container. The SDK container has copies of the Matter SDK tools (binary executables) which can be used to play the role of clients and servers of the Matter protocol in test interactions, either as Test Harness actuators or DUT simulators. That container gets automatically created and destroyed by the server-side logic at the start and at the end, respectively, of a Test Suite which needs actuators or simulators. The OTBR container, on the other hand, hosts an instance of the Open Thread Border Router and needs to be explicitly started by the TH user when they want to test a real Matter device that runs over a Thread fabric, as described in <<ot-border-router-otbr-setup, Section 7, OT Border Router (OTBR) Setup>>.



=== Data Model

<<<
== *Getting Started with Matter Test-Harness (TH)*

The Matter Node (DUT) that is used for certification testing can either be a commissioner, controller or controlee. 

If the DUT is a controlee (e.g., light bulb), the TH spins a reference commissioner/controller using chip-tool binary shipped with the SDK. The TH commissioner provisions the DUT and is used to execute the certification tests on the controlee. 

If the DUT is a commissioner/controller, the Test TH spins an example accessory that is shipped with the SDK and uses that for the DUT to provision, control and run certification tests.

Refer to <<bringing-up-of-matter-node-dut-for-certification-testing, Section 5, Bringing Up of Matter Node (DUT) for Certification Testing>> to bring up the DUT and then proceed with device testing by referring to <<test-configuration, Section 8, Test Configuration>>.

For hobby developers who want to get acquainted with certification tools/process/TC’s, can spin DUT’s using the example apps provided in the SDK. Refer to the instructions to set up one https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document/folder/3661[here].

The TH runs on the official *{ubuntu-description}* version. If the TH device happens to be using a different Ubuntu release or other OS, we strongly recommend fresh installing version {ubuntu-description} for reliable results.

The official installation method uses a Raspberry Pi (<<fresh_install>>), but there's an alternative method used in the tool's development that uses a virtual machine instead (<<th-installation-without-a-raspberry-pi>>). Keep in mind that thread networking is not officially supported in VM installations at the moment.

=== TH Installation on Raspberry Pi

There are two ways to obtain the latest TH on Raspberry Pi. Follow the instructions in <<th-installation-on-raspberry-pi, Section 4.1.2, TH Installation on Raspberry Pi>> to install TH from scratch OR if you already have the TH, follow the instructions in <<update-existing-th, Section 4.4, Update Existing TH>> to update the TH.

NOTE: This instruction applies to the latest version of the Test Harness this document refers to. For earlier versions of the TH please follow the user guide of that specific TH version as, for example, Ubuntu versions might differ per installation.

==== Prerequisites

The following equipment will be required to have a complete TH setup:

* *Raspberry Pi Version (4 or 5) with SD card of minimum 64 GB Memory*

The TH will be installed on Raspberry PI. The TH contains couple of docker container(s) with all the required dependencies for certification tests execution.

* *Windows or Linux System (Laptop/Desktop/Mac)*

The Mac/PC will be used to flash the Ubuntu image on the SD card to be used on Raspberry Pi. Download the https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi Imager] or https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Balena Etcher] tool. The same can be used to set up the required build environment for the Matter SDK or building Matter reference apps for various platforms. 

* *RCP dongle*

If the DUT supports thread transport, an RCP dongle provisioned with a recommended RCP firmware for the default OTBR router that comes with the TH will be required to function properly. Currently, the OTBR can work with a Nordic RCP dongle or a SiLabs RCP dongle. Refer to <<ot-border-router-otbr-setup, Section 6, OT Border Router (OTBR) Setup>> on how to install the RCP firmware.

==== TH Installation on Raspberry Pi

NOTE: **Starting with version v2.10 we have moved from distributing TH as an SD-Card image to publishing the TH Docker containers at Github Container Registry and pulling them at install time. By doing that the release process has been made much faster and less error-prone, while at the same time installation time has gone shorter.**

. Place the blank SD card into the user’s system USB slot. 
. Open the https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi Imager] or https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Balena Etcher] tool on the Mac/PC and select the '{ubuntu-description}'.
* Edit the SO custom settings to: 
** username: ubuntu
+
WARNING: **The username must be 'ubuntu'. Changing the name may cause problems running TH.**

** password: raspberrypi
** hostname: ubuntu
* Make sure you have enabled the SSH service.
. After the SD card has been flashed, remove the SD card and place it in the Raspberry Pi’s memory card slot.
. Power on the Raspberry Pi and ensure that the local area network, display monitor and keyboard are connected.
. Enter the username and password.
. Install the TH system:
* Clone the TH repository: 
** `$git clone -b <Target_Branch/Tag> https://github.com/project-chip/certification-tool.git`
* Goto to TH folder: 
** `$cd certification-tool`
* Install/configure the TH dependencies: 
** `$./scripts/pi-setup/auto-install.sh`
** At the end of the script, select option 1 to restart the RaspberryPi.
. Wait about 10 minutes. 
. Using the _ifconfig_ command, obtain the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. The same IP address will be used to launch the TH user interface on the user's system using the browser.
. Proceed with test configuration and execution (refer to <<test-configuration, Section 8, Test Configuration>> and <<test-case-execution, Section 9, Test Case Execution>> respectively).

=== TH installation without a Raspberry Pi

The official installation method uses a Raspberry Pi (<<th-installation-on-raspberry-pi, TH Installation on Raspberry Pi>>). **This alternative installation method is targeted for development purpose and it only supports onnetwork pairing mode.**

NOTE: To install TH without using a Raspberry Pi you'll need a machine with {ubuntu-description}. You can <<create-an-ubuntu-virtual-machine, create a virtual machine>> for this purpose, but *be aware that if the host's architecture is not arm64* you'll need to substitute `backend`, `frontend` and <<substitute-the-sdks-docker-image-and-update-sample-apps, the SDK's docker image>> in order for it to work properly.

NOTE: Images for linux/amd64 will not always be available in the github registry. So, if necessary, the images need to be built locally using the following script: +
`./certification-tool/scripts/build.sh`

==== Create an Ubuntu virtual machine

Here's an example of how to create a virtual machine for TH using multipass (https://multipass.run/).
|===
|Please make sure the docker images are compatible with the host architecture.
|===

* Install multipass

|===
|`brew install multipass`
|===

* Create new VM with {ubuntu-description} (2 cpu cores, 8G mem and a 50G disk)

|===
|`multipass launch {ubuntu-version} -n matter-vm -c 2 -m 8G -d 50G`
|===

* SSH into VM

|===
|`multipass shell matter-vm`
|===

NOTE: About Multipass: +
Seems like bridged network is not available, so you will not be able to test with DUT outside the docker container, but you can develop using the sample apps on the platform.

==== Setup TH in Ubuntu

* Clone git repo

|===
|`git clone -b <Target_Branch/Tag> https://github.com/project-chip/certification-tool.git`
|===

* Go into the repo directory

|===
|`cd certification-tool`
|===

* Run TH auto install script

|===
|`./scripts/ubuntu/auto-install.sh`
|===

* Reboot VM

If using multipass, to find the IP address use the command

|===
|`multipass list`
|===

==== Substitute the SDK's docker image and update sample apps

If the platform of the machine that will run the TH is 'linux/arm64' it will not be necessary to build a new SDK docker image.

To run TH on a machine using the 'linux/amd64' platform, you will need to first build a new SDK docker image.

* Get the SDK commit SHA

|===
|Value for variable `SDK_DOCKER_TAG` in TH repository path `certification-tool/backend/app/core/config.py`
|===

* Download the Dockerfile for chip-cert-bins from the commit you need

|===
|Substitute <COMMIT_SHA> with the value from `SDK_DOCKER_TAG`: +
`github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/<COMMIT_SHA>/integrations/docker/images/chip-cert-bins/Dockerfile`
|===

* Copy Docker file to TH's machine

* Make sure that no other SDK image for that commit SHA is loaded in the machine

|===
|Run `docker images` +
If there's an image with a tag for the commit you're using, delete that image +
`docker image rm <IMAGE_ID>`
|===

* Build new SDK image (this could take about 3 hours)

|===
|Substitute <COMMIT_SHA> with the value from `SDK_DOCKER_TAG`: +
`docker buildx build --load --build-arg COMMITHASH=<COMMIT_SHA> --tag connectedhomeip/chip-cert-bins:<COMMIT_SHA> .`
|===

* Update TH sample apps

|===
|To update your sample apps using the new image run this script in the certification-tool repository +
`./backend/test_collections/matter/scripts/update-sample-apps.sh`
|===

=== Update Existing TH
WARNING: If the Operating System is not the *{ubuntu-description}*, please flash and use a SD card with that Ubuntu release to use this version of Test Harness. Beware that the auto update process below will fail in the case of a different release version.

To update an existing TH environment, follow the instructions below on the terminal.

|===
|`cd ~/certification-tool` +
`./scripts/ubuntu/auto-update.sh <Target_Branch/Tag>` +
`./scripts/start.sh`

Wait for 10 mins and open the TH application using the browser
|===

=== Updating Existing Yaml Test Script

It is possible to update yaml test script content by directly editing the file content. It is useful when validating small changes or fixing misspelled commands.

Yaml files are located at:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/yaml_tests/yaml/sdk/`
|===

To update an existing Yaml test script: (e.g. `Test_TC_ACE_1_1.yaml`)

* Open the script file:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/yaml_tests/yaml/sdk/Test_TC_ACE_1_1.yaml`
|===

* Update/change the desired information.

* Save and close the file.

* Restart TH's backend container:
|===
|`$docker restart certification-tool_backend_1`
|===

* Changes will be available on the next execution of the yaml test.

To create a new Yaml test script:

* Use an existing test script as a starting point.

* Rename the file to a new one: e.g. `Test_TC_ACE_1_1.yaml` to `Test_TC_ACE_9_9.yaml`

* Update the name entry inside the yaml file:

|===
|**FROM** name: 42.1.1. `[TC-ACE-1.1]` Privileges

**TO** name: 42.1.1. `[TC-ACE-9.9]` Privileges
|===

* Proceed as explained on updating an existent yaml file.


=== Customized Test Scripts (Yaml/Python Tests)

To use customized tests, the files must be placed in the specific folder (described below). This way, Test-Harness will load and display the available tests on the interface.
These tests will not be affected if the system is restarted or if the SDK Yaml tests are updated.

Custom Yaml files folder are located at:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/yaml_tests/yaml/custom/`
|===

Custom Python files folder are located at:
|===
|`~/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/python_testing/scripts/custom/`
|===

.Test-Harness displaying the custom tests.

== *Bringing Up of Matter Node (DUT) for Certification Testing*

A Matter node can either be a commissioner, controller, controlee, software component or an application. The Matter SDK comes with a few example apps that can be used by Vendors as a reference to build their products. Refer to the examples folder in the https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip[SDK github repo] for the same.

DUT vendors need to get the device flashed with the production firmware revision that they want to get their device certified and execute all the applicable TC’s for their products using the TH. DUT vendors can skip the below sections as the TH brings up the reference applications automatically during the certification tests execution.

A hobby developer can build Matter reference apps either using a Raspberry Pi or Nordic DK board (if the user wants to use thread transport). Follow the instructions below for the <<bringing-up-of-reference-matter-node-dut-on-raspberry-pi, Raspberry Pi>> and <<bringing-up-of-reference-matter-node-dut-on-thread-platform, Nordic>> platforms. 

=== Bringing Up of Reference Matter Node (DUT) on Raspberry Pi

In the case where a device maker/hobby developer needs to bring up a sample/reference DUT, i.e. light bulb, door lock, etc. using the example apps provided in SDK and verify provisioning of the DUT over the Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces, follow the below steps to set up the DUT.

Users can either use the example apps (i.e. light bulb, door lock, etc.) that are shipped with the TH OR build the apps from the latest SDK source. 

To use the apps that are shipped with the TH, follow the instructions below:

* Do a fresh install of TH (<<fresh_install, Installation on Raspberry Pi>>).

If any issue occurs while using *otbr_start.sh*, follow the steps below to generate the dataset value manually: 

*On Terminal 1:*

. Follow the steps below to build the OTBR docker:
.. Create the docker network by executing the following commands:
+
|===
|`sudo docker network create --ipv6 --subnet fd11:db8:1::/64 -o com.docker.network.bridge.name=otbr0 otbr` +
`sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.otbr0.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen=128` +
`sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.otbr0.accept_ra=2`
|===

.. Run the dependency:
+
|===
|`sudo modprobe ip6table_filter`
|===


.. Run the docker:
+
|===
|`sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged --network otbr -p 8080:80 --sysctl "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1" --name otbr -e NAT64=0 --volume /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 nrfconnect/otbr:9185bda --radio-url spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyACM0`
|===

. Generate the Thread form for dataset by entering ‘<Raspberry-Pi IP>:8080’ on the user’s system browser. The OTBR form will be generated as shown below. 
. Click on the *Form* option and follow the sequence to generate the OTBR form.

== *Wi-Fi PAF Commissioning*

This section provides a guide to enable Wi-Fi PAF commissioning tests.

=== Components Needed for Tests
To enable the Wi-Fi PAF Commissioning tests, the following hardware and software components are required.

==== Hardware
* *Raspberry Pi*: version [TBF: version number] permissible for CSA Matter Test Events, used as a platform for Test Harness(Pi 4 or higher).
* *WLAN USB dongle*: compatible with the latest hostapd and
wpa_supplicant, used as the Wi-Fi subsystem for transmitting and
receiving Wi-Fi Un-Synchronized Discovery (USD) Public Action Frames
(PAF), including one of the following kinds:
** NETGEAR A6210: https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Dual-Band-Adapter-A6210-10000S-Refurbished/dp/B00NSB0G66
** NETGEAR WN111 802.11n Wireless LAN USB 2.0 Adapter: https://a.co/d/4I7YMez
** Linksys AE6000 Dual-Band Wireless Mini USB Adapter: https://a.co/d/iyXXpIs
** SANOXY USB Mini Wifi Wireless LAN Internet Adapter: https://www.amazon.com/SANOXY-150Mbps-Wireless-Network-802-11n/dp/B01HFRCUVM

==== Software
* *hostapd and wpa_supplicant*: download from the latest master branch. Make sure this exists: CONFIG_NAN_USD=y
** Used to enable transmitting and receiving Wi-Fi Un-Synchronized
Discovery (USD) Public Action Frames (PAF) on platforms for both
Test Harness and DUT.
** *Here is the procedure to configure the above*:
*** git clone https://w1.fi/hostap.git
*** cd hostap/wpa_supplicant
*** git checkout master (Run this if you are in different branch)
*** vi defconfig or nano defconfig
*** Make sure "CONFIG_NAN_USD=y" is set (It should be at the last line)
*** cp defconfig .config
*** sudo apt update
*** sudo apt install libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev
*** make all

=== Matter SDK
* Regular build command with “chip_device_config_enable_wifipaf=true” (*This step is required only when building from the Master branch. If you're using the SDK provided in the apps folder of the TH, it's not needed*)
* *Test commands on SDK as a Commissionee*:
** `$ ./chip-all-clusters-app --wifi --wifipaf freq_list=2437` // for 2.4GHz.
** `$ ./chip-all-clusters-app --wifi --wifipaf freq_list=2437,2412,5745,5220` // for default 2.4GHz CH6 + a list of channels in 2.4GHz + a list of 5GHz channels
* *Test commands on SDK as a Commissioner*: +
Use "wifipaf-wifi" to pair: +
** `./chip-tool-paf pairing wifipaf-wifi [node_id] [ssid] [ap_pwd] [passcode] [discriminator]`
** *Example*: `./chip-tool-paf pairing wifipaf-wifi 1 n_m_2g nxp12345 20202021 3840` // on default 2.4GHz
** *Example*: `sudo ./chip-tool pairing wifipaf-wifi 1 n_m_2g nxp12345 20202021 3840 --freq 5220` // on 5GHz

=== Baseline Test Harness (TH) Configuration for Testing DUT Commissionable Device
1. If DUT commissionable device is 2.4 GHz-only, configure TH commissioner to create an active subscriber on Default Publish Channel (2.4GHz Channel 6) for a test.
2. If DUT commissionable device is 2.4 + 5 GHz, to test 2.4GHz commissioning, configure TH commissioner to create an active subscriber on Default Publish Channel (2.4GHz Channel 6) for a test.
3. If DUT commissionable device is 2.4 + 5 GHz, to test 5GHz commissioning, configure TH commissioner to create an active subscriber on CH 44 non-ETSI regulatory domains or CH 149 in ETSI regulatory for a test.

=== Baseline Test Harness (TH) Configuration for Testing DUT Commissioner
For non-ETSI regulatory domain, configure the TH Commissionee with the Default Publish Channel to be Channel 6 in 2.4 GHz and a Publish Channel List that includes all 20 MHz channels in 2.4 GHz band, Channel 44 and Channel 149 in 5 GHz band, and the Commissioner's network operating channel if the operating channel is not a DFS channel.

=== Test Procedures and Test Commands
The test procedures and test commands for Wi-Fi PAF commissioning are documented in the Test Plan Verification spreadsheet under the Matter Specifications and Test Plans folder:
https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document/folder/2269 *or* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZAbIRObi1HcvbesI4tSVmQn7cxz-ZNyFH80onmae7Y/edit?gid=311763523#gid=311763523

*The test steps are specifically in the following places*:

* 3.2.1. [TC-DD-2.1] Announcement by Device Verification [DUT - Commissionee]: Steps: 8, 9, 10, and 11 with “MCORE.DD.DISCOVERY_PAF” enabled in PICS.
** TH does not need any special setting, just need to connect to AP. It's ok even using ethernet. But Wi-Fi should be on that I always test by using Wi-Fi connecting to AP. Test wpa_supplicant configure file script is below:
*** ctrl_interface=DIR=/run/wpa_supplicant
*** update_config=1
*** network={
  +
  ssid="n_m_2g"
  +
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  +
  psk="nxp12345"
  +
}
** *Before executing TC-DD-2.1 please read the “readme” file available in the TC-DD-2.1 folder and complete the configuration.*
* 3.2.2. [TC-DD-2.2] Discovery by Commissioner Verification [DUT - Commissioner]: Steps: 3.a and 3.b with “MCORE.DD.DISCOVERY_PAF” enabled in PICS.
* 3.3.11. [TC-DD-3.11] Commissioning Flow = 0 (Standard Flow) - QR Code [DUT - Commissioner]: Steps: 2.a, 2.b and 2.c with “MCORE.DD.DISCOVERY_PAF” enabled in PICS
* 3.3.12. [TC-DD-3.12] Commissioning Flow = 1 (User-Intent Flow) - QR Code [DUT - Commissioner]: Steps: 2.a, 2.b, 2.c and 2.d with “MCORE.DD.DISCOVERY_PAF” enabled in PICS
* 3.3.13. [TC-DD-3.13] Commissioning Flow = 2 (Custom Flow) - QR Code [DUT - Commissioner]: Steps: 2.a, 2.b, 2.c and 2.d with “MCORE.DD.DISCOVERY_PAF” enabled in PICS
* 3.3.14. [TC-DD-3.14] Commissioning Flow - QR Code - Negative Scenario [DUT - Commissioner]: Steps: 4.a and 4.b with “MCORE.DD.DISCOVERY_PAF” enabled in PICS

=== Configure the environment

** Configure the wpa_supplicant on the commissionee side using the
provided example file named wpa_supplicant-def_comm.conf.
** Run `./config_paf_env.sh comee` (*Make sure the “config_paf_env.sh” file from the “scripts” folder inside the provided ZIP archive is copied to the working directory before executing this command*).
* *Configure it as commissioner*:
** Configure the wpa_supplicant on the commissionee side using the
provided example file named wpa_supplicant-def_comer.conf.
** Set the ssid/password of AP to wpa_supplicant-def_comer.conf
** Run `./config_paf_env.sh comer` (*Make sure the “config_paf_env.sh” file from the “scripts” folder inside the provided ZIP archive is copied to the working directory before executing this command*).
* Renew the commissionee environment before running the test:
** Run `./renew_paf_comee.sh` (*Make sure the “renew_paf_comee.sh file from the “scripts” folder inside the provided ZIP archive is copied to the working directory before executing this command*)
** The above script is just clearing the tmp files and removing the
existing networks.

== *Test Configuration*

=== Project Configuration

When the DUT is a client, refer to <<simulated-tests>>. The TH brings up the example accessory using chip-app1 binary. The user will be prompted to commission the device. Once the commissioning process is completed, proceed with the test execution.

In the case where the DUT is a server, the TH spins up the controller, the DUT bring-up procedure should be completed and has to be paired with the controller. 

Depending on the DUT’s network transport, any one of the appropriate pairing modes can be opted:

* *‘ble-wifi* ’ to complete the pairing for the DUT using BLE Wi-Fi 
* *‘onnetwork’* to complete the pairing for the DUT that is already on the operational network (e.g., the device is already present on the same Ethernet network of the TH) connection
* *‘ble-thread’* to complete the pairing for the Thread Device

Follow the sections below for the project configuration and test execution.

==== Projects Menu
. Open a Web browser from the user's system and enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi as given in <<th-installation-on-raspberry-pi, Section 4.1.2, TH Installation on Raspberry Pi>>.

== *Test Case Execution*

Refer to <<references, Section 2, References>> for PICS tool documentation to generate the PICS XML files.

PICS (_Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement_) is a list of features supported by a device as defined by a technology _protocol_ , standard or specification. Each feature is known as a _PICS Item_ , and device _implementation_ is either mandatory or optional. PICS is used by the device manufacturer as a _statement_ of _conformance to_ a technology standard and a requirement for all CSA Product Certification programs.

PICS codes are generated from the Test Plans. The Base.xml file lists all the Core feature PICS from the Matter Base Specifications and the application cluster PICS are listed in the respective TestPlan.xml files. Follow the steps below to generate and upload the PICS files.

. Click on the following link to download the PICS XML files— https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document/folder/4120[https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document/folder/4120]
. Click on the following link to use the PICS tool— https://picstool.csa-iot.org/#userguide[PICS Tool v1.6.4 matter 1.0 - Connectivity Standards Alliance (csa-iot.org)]
. Load the Base.xml file by clicking on the *Browse* option. In case the following error is observed:
+
WARNING: *Base.xml: This XML PICS template is unapproved and has not been tested with this tool. To test new or updated PICS documents, please enable _author mode_ and try again.*
+
Enable author mode and retry uploading the XML file.
+
image:images/img_31.png[]

. Load the XML file that is required for testing, e.g., Doorlock.xml.
. Check the option for which the testing will be done for the DoorLock cluster. In the case of the Door Lock cluster to be tested in the Server mode, select the checkbox for DRLK.S. In case the cluster has to be tested in the Client mode, select the checkbox for DRLK.C.
+
image:images/img_56.png[]

. Review all the attributes/commands that are supported by the DoorLock cluster and ensure the corresponding options are checked in the PICS tool.
. Click on *Validate PICS* . Ensure that there are no warnings or errors. In case of any warnings or errors, revisit the options and check/uncheck the options as supported by the DUT.
+
image:images/img_32.png[]

. Prior to the test execution, the user will have to load the relevant PICS file to list the required test cases. Depending on the PICS file loaded, the test suites list will be updated accordingly.
+

=== Automated and Semi Automated Tests

==== Automated Test Cases

Click on the *SDK YAML Tests* tab. The automated and semi automated test cases will be listed in **FirstChipToolSuite**. The Automated test cases will be listed as the TC-<Cluster>-XX without any suffix, e.g., TC-DRLK-1.1. Automated test case execution will not require any manual intervention.

==== Semi Automated Test Cases

The Semi Automated test cases will be listed as TC-<Cluster>-XX(Semi-automated). During the Semi Automated test case execution, some of the steps will be executed automatically and the user will be prompted to perform a few steps as shown below in the screenshots. From the TH user interface, load the required PICS file to select the test cases, e.g., Doorlock Test Plan.xml.

Select the required Semi Automated test case to be executed and ensure other test cases are not selected. Take for example TC-ACE-1.6 as shown below:

image:images/img_34.png[]

Bring up the DUT (All Clusters as Server) by sending the following command `./chip-all-clusters-app` on the Raspberry Pi terminal and click on the *Start* button.

During the Test execution, as the log gets updated, copy the newly generated node ID.

image:images/img_35.png[]

Form the Chip-tool, execute the above command with node ID listed in the TH log. Save the Chip-tool logs in a text file. Verify the result in the Chip-tool log and select the applicable choice from the user prompt in the TH tool and select the *Submit* button.


|===
|Example: +
`docker exec -it th-sdk <popup command> <newly generated nodeID> <end-point id>`

`cd apps` +
`docker exec -it th-sdk ./chip-tool groups view-group 0x0105 Oxb1d2ee23dcf2f18b 0`
|===


Check for the response of the command in the Chip-tool log and compare with the expected response from the TH user prompt as shown below. In case both the responses match, click on *PASS* followed by the *Submit* button.

image:images/img_36.png[]

At the end of the test execution, the user will be prompted to upload the Chip-tool logs that were saved in the previous step.

=== Python Tests

The Onboarding Payload Device Discovery test cases are listed under this option. Before executing the Python tests, bring up the DUT in the Chip-tool and save the discovery log. During the Python test execution, the user is prompted to input data such as QR code. Copy the data from the previously saved logs and provide the input. Follow the sequence below to execute the python_tests.

During the DUT bring-up, note down the QR code and save it for future use.

image:images/img_37.png[]

Select the python_tests tab for the test execution.

image:images/img_38.png[]

During the test execution the user is prompted for the QR code. Use the code that was saved earlier and proceed with the testing.

image:images/img_39.png[]

=== Manual Tests

During the manual test case execution, the user is prompted for an action for each test step as shown below.

image:images/img_40.png[]

After the Manual pairing of the DUT, execute the command displayed on the prompt as shown below.

|===
|Example:  `./apps/chip-tool doorlock read-event door_lock-alarm 1 1`
|===

Save the Chip-tool logs in a text file. Validate the chip tool log and select the applicable choice from the user prompt in the TH tool and select the *Submit* button. At the end of the test execution, the user is prompted to upload the Chip-tool logs that were saved in the previous step.

=== Simulated Tests

Simulated tests must be executed when the DUT is considered as a Client. The simulated test cases will be listed in **FirstAppSuite** under the *SDK YAML Tests* tab.

image:images/img_59.png[]

During the execution of these tests, the user is prompted for an action to be performed on the device as shown in the following screenshot.

Follow the instructions provided in the user prompt to complete the test execution.

image:images/img_41.png[]

|===
|IMPORTANT: Currently the selection will be done automatically by TH based on the test execution result. In the future the User Prompt will be updated to proper represent this behavior.
|===

=== SDK Python Tests

==== Run Tests Inside SDK Docker Container

Some automated Python scripts are available inside the docker of the TH.

E.g.: TC_ACE_1_3.py, TC_ACE_1_4.py , TC_CGEN_2_4.py , TC_DA_1_7.py , TC_RR_1_1.py  TC_SC_3_6.py

Follow the instructions below to execute the test cases.

===== Prerequisite

. A directory containing the PAA (Product) roots that will be mounted as /paa_roots.
. Run the following commands from the Raspberry Pi terminal.

+
|===
|`cd certification-tool` +
`./backend/test_collections/matter/scripts/update-paa-certs.sh`
|===

. After execution of the above commands ensure that the PAA’s are available locally at */var/paa-root-certs* .


===== Mapped Volumes
The following host directories are mapped into the cert-bins container:

* `/root/python_testing` -> `/home/ubuntu/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/python_testing`
* `/paa-root-certs` -> `/var/paa-root-certs`
* `/credentials/development` -> `/var/credentials/development`

===== Placeholders for Steps

Device-specific configuration is shown as shell variables. *PLEASE REPLACE THOSE WITH THE CORRECT VALUE* in the steps below.

* *$PATH_TO_PAA_ROOTS*: Path on host where PAA roots are located. Failure to provide a correct path will cause early failure during commissioning (e.g., /var/paa-root-certs/)
* *$DISCRIMINATOR*: Long discriminator for DUT (e.g., 3840 for Linux examples)
* *$SETUP_PASSCODE*: Setup passcode for DUT (e.g., 20202021 for Linux examples)
* *$WIFI_SSID*: SSID of Wi-Fi AP to which to attempt connection 
+
WARNING: Currently, WIFI_SSID with special characters or empty spaces is not supported.
* *$WIFI_PASSPHRASE*: Passphrase of Wi-Fi AP to which to attempt connection
* *$BLE_INTERFACE_ID*: Interface ID for BLE interface (e.g., 0 for default, which usually works)
* *$THREAD_DATASET_HEX*: Thread operational dataset as a hex string (e.g., output of dataset active -x in OpenThread CLI on an existing end-device

===== Common Steps

|===
|Factory-reset the DUT

`docker run -v $PATH_TO_PAA_ROOTS:/paa_roots -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket -v /home/ubuntu/certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/sdk_tests/sdk_checkout/python_testing:/root/python_testing -v $(pwd):/launch_dir --privileged --network host -it connectedhomeip/chip-cert-bins:<SDK SHA RECOMMENDED>`
|===

This downloads a Docker image with the test environment, and runs the environment including mounting the PAA trust store in */paa_roots* and mounts the local Avahi socket so that Avahi in the VM can run against its host.

* You will be shown a *#* root prompt

NOTE: *The first time running docker will be SLOW (around 5 minutes) due to the need to download data. Every other run after that will be instant.*

===== For On-Network Pairing

Execute the following command:

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/scripts/sdk/TC_RR_1_1.py --discriminator $DISCRIMINATOR --passcode $SETUP_PASSCODE --commissioning-method on-network --paa-trust-store-path /paa_roots --storage-path admin_storage.json`
|===

To test this against a Linux target running on the same network as the host:

|===
|`clear && rm -f kvs1 && ./chip-all-clusters-app --discriminator 3842 --KVS kvs1 --trace_decode 1`
|===


[NOTE]
==== 
* The $DISCRIMINATOR to be used will be 3842 in this example.
* The *rm -f kvs1* is a factory reset.
====

===== For BLE+Wi-Fi Pairing

Execute the following command in the docker for the BLE+Wi-Fi pairing:

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/scripts/sdk/TC_RR_1_1.py --discriminator $DISCRIMINATOR --passcode $SETUP_PASSCODE --commissioning-method ble-wifi --paa-trust-store-path /paa_roots --storage-path admin_storage.json --wifi-ssid $WIFI_SSID --wifi-passphrase $WIFI_PASSPHRASE --ble-interface-id $BLE_INTERFACE_ID`
|===

===== For BLE+Thread Pairing

Execute the below command in the docker for the BLE+Thread pairing:

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/scripts/sdk/TC_RR_1_1.py --discriminator $DISCRIMINATOR --passcode $SETUP_PASSCODE --commissioning-method ble-thread --paa-trust-store-path /paa_roots --storage-path admin_storage.json --thread-dataset-hex $THREAD_DATASET_HEX --ble-interface-id $BLE_INTERFACE_ID`
|===


===== Post-Test Steps

Factory reset the DUT again → The test fills tons of stuff and the device will be in an odd state of ACL’s. This will be fixed once there is ample time to clean up after the test is completed by sending commands to, for example, remove the fabrics joined.

===== Possible Issues

* Failing at Step 9 during execution of TC_RR_1_1:
.. Some DUT’s have an incorrectly-configured UserLabel cluster where the backend is not implemented due to SDK example issues where some examples have the backend and others do not. This will fail at the last step ("Step 9: Fill UserLabel clusters on each endpoint"), with FAILURE writes. To override the test not to run this step, you can add "*--bool-arg skip_user_label_cluster_steps:true*" to the command line of *TC_RR_1_1.py*, at the end.
.. Not having the *$PATH_TO_PAA_ROOTS* set properly when starting the docker or not having PAA roots certificates at that path.
.. Follow the instructions for item 2 in <<prerequisite, Section 9.5.1.1, Prerequisite>>.

====== Common Test Failures

The documents in this https://github.com/project-chip/matter-test-scripts/tree/main/docs/common_test_failures[link] are intended to be used to help root-cause common test failures, especially in cases where the underlying cause of the failure may not be immediately obvious from the test step or expected outcomes.

==== Run Tests on the TH User Interface

Some automated Python scripts are available in TH User Interface.

To execute the tests, the parameters *discriminator*, *setup_code* and *pairing_mode* need to be filled in the device configuration parameters (*dut_config*).

To configure specific/custom parameters, please edit the project configuration to include the parameters in the session (*test_parameters*).

===== Test suites

TH expects the SDK Python Tests to follow a certain template. New tests are being written with this template and the old tests are being updated to conform to it. The tests are divided in 3 test suites:

image:images/img_61.png[SDK Python Tests - Suites]

. Python Testing Suite
  * For test cases that follow the expected template and have a commissioning first step.
  * The user will be asked to make sure that the DUT is in Commissioning Mode at the start of the test suite setup and then the DUT will be commissioned.
  * The commissioning will be kept throughout the execution of all its tests.
. Python Testing Suite - No commissioning
  * For test cases that follow the expected template but don't have a commissioning first step.
  * The selected tests will be executed without commissioning the DUT.
  * The user will be asked to make sure that the DUT is in Commissioning Mode at the start of each test.
. Python Testing Suite - Old script format
  * For test cases that don't follow the expected template yet.
  * The user will be asked to make sure that the DUT is in Commissioning Mode at the start of each test.
  * The user will also be asked if the DUT should be commissioned at the start of each test. The DUT will be commissioned depending on the user's answer.

image:images/img_62.png[SDK Python Tests - Commissioning Mode prompt]

image:images/img_63.png[SDK Python Tests - DUT should be commissioned prompt]

===== Reuse commissioning information
This allows users to perform multiple test run executions without the need to perform the commissioning step in every test run execution.
The TH is now storing the last commissioning information, so a prompt will presented asking user to reuse those previous commissioning information or if he wants to perform a new commissioning procedure.

<<<
== *Platform certification configuration*
Platform certification is the process of validating that a hardware or software platform meets specific technical and compliance standards. Certifying the platform allows device manufacturers to build products using a pre-approved foundation, reducing development time and simplifying the certification process for their final products.

=== Selecting Test Cases Rules
The Test Harness applies different rules to pre-select test cases depending on the type of certification being performed. The selection process considers specific flags present in the PICS file and, in certain cases—such as when PICS_PLAT_CERT or PICS_PLAT_CERT_DONE PICS are present, it also evaluates the contents of additional configuration files, namely `generated-platform-cert-test-list.json` and `dmp-test-skip.xml`.


The `dmp-test-skip.xml` file is provided by the PICS Tool, while the `generated-platform-cert-test-list.json` file is a static file maintained by the Platform team. The `generated-platform-cert-test-list.json` file can be found in the `./backend/test_collections/matter/platform-cert` directory.

The three selection modes are:

* *Platform Certification*
* *Derived Product Certification* 
* *Full Product Certification*
  
Each mode is designed to ensure that only the relevant test cases are executed based on the scope and purpose of the certification.


==== Platform Certification
In this mode, the product is being certified as a platform. The behavior is defined as follows:

* The PICS file must contain the `PICS_PLAT_CERT` flag set to `True`.
* The TH will pre-select test cases that:
** Are explicitly listed in the `generated-platform-cert-test-list.json` file.
** Comply with the standard PICS rules.

==== Derived Product Certification
This mode applies to products built on a previously certified platform. The behavior is:

* The PICS file must contain the `PICS_PLAT_CERT_DONE` flag set to `True`, along with any product-specific PICS entries.
* The TH will pre-select test cases that:
** Comply with the standard PICS rules.
** Are **not** listed in the `dmp-test-skip.xml` (DMP file).

==== Full Product Certification
This is the default mode when the product does not fall under the previous two categories:

* The PICS file may contain any PICS entries, except `PICS_PLAT_CERT` and `PICS_PLAT_CERT_DONE`.
* The TH will pre-select test cases according to standard PICS rules only.

=== Configuration Input

On the project configuration screen, users can upload both the PICS file and the optional `dmp-test-skip.xml` file. Based on the content of the PICS file, the TH determines the certification mode by checking the values of the following flags:

* `MCORE.PLAT_CERT = True` → Platform Certification
* `MCORE.PLAT_CERT_DONE = True` → Derived Product Certification
* Neither flag set → Full Product Certification

This logic enables the TH to filter and pre-select the appropriate test cases based on the selected certification type.

The `dmp-test-skip.xml` file can be uploaded either by dragging and dropping the file into the upload area or by manually selecting it. Note that only one DMP file is accepted at a time. If a second DMP file is uploaded, the previous configuration will be discarded. 

[NOTE]
====
The file must be named exactly `dmp-test-skip.xml`. Renaming the file will result in it being ignored by the Test Harness.
====

Once the DMP file is uploaded, its content can be viewed in the panel on the left under the "dmp_test_skip" item, as shown in the figure.

image:images/img_68.png[Platform Certification - Upload dmp-test-skip.xml file]
