== *Collect Logs and Submit to TEDS*

DUT’s that require certification from CSA, need to submit the results to CSA’s TEDS portal for ATL’s to review the test results. 

Any hobby developer that is executing these tests using TH need not submit results to TEDS. 

=== Instructions to Download Test Results

==== From the TH User Interface

After completing the test case execution, the user has two options to download the test logs and test reports.

From the Test Execution page, you can download reports and logs as shown below.

Test logs and reports can also be retrieved from the Test-Run page as shown below.

==== Python Tests in Docker

When executing Python tests from the Docker, pipe test logs to file. 

|===
|`rm -f admin_storage.json && python3 python_testing/TC_<test_case>.py <test_parameters> \| tee /launch_dir/<test_log_file>.log`
|===

Result logs will be available typically under the TH home directory where the docker container is launched.

=== Upload Test Results

To upload test results, you must log in to TEDS.

==== Results Recording

Go to your assigned time slot on your dashboard under “Test Slots” and select *Add test results* in your test slot details.

* Base Device Tests: These tests are required for all DUT’s.
* Controller Tests: These tests are only required for Controller devices. If you register your device as a controller, you need to complete this testing. 
* Cluster Tests: This is a list of all Matter clusters. Here you will enter the test results for the clusters your DUT supports.

==== Base Device Results Recording

Selecting “Base Device Tests” from the menu will take you to Based Device tests. +
The left panel is where you select tests and record your results. +
The right panel displays the tests you have recorded for a particular set of tests.

=== Test Results Summary

When all testing has completed for your DUT, you can review the results in the “Test Results Summary” page.

In this summary you can check to see if a particular test case has been reviewed. If the test has been reviewed, you will see the “Test Reviewed” and “Test House Notes” statuses.
