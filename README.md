# CSA Certification Tool

## About

With the goal of simplifying development, testing, and certification of devices, the Connectivity Standards Alliance has developed a standardized set of tools as well a test harness that is presently used for Matter certifications.

To learn more about the open-source [Matter SDK](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip), please read more [here](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)

## Project Overview

### Goals

The test tooling, harness, and scripts are developed with the following goals and principles in mind:

**Proven:** The test harness and tools are built with and on top of existing technologies where possible.

**Robust:** The test harness and tools should be reliable and dependable.

**Low Cost:** The test harness and tools should run on low cost and accessible devices.

**Flexible:** The test harness and tools are flexible enough to accommodate deployment in different environments.

**Easy to Use:** The test harness and tools provide a smooth, cohesive, integrated experience.

**Open:** The Projectâ€™s design and technical processes are open and transparent
to the general public, including non-members wherever possible.

# Instructions

Detailed instructions for how to use this set of tools with [Matter](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) are located [here](./docs/Matter_User_Guide/Matter_User_Guide.md)

## Related Repositories

Please be aware of these related repositories that all have to be used in concert to build, develop with, and use the certification tools

-   [Tool Frontend](https://github.com/project-chip/certification-tool-frontend)
-   [Tool Backend](https://github.com/project-chip/certification-tool-backend)
-   [CLI Tool ](https://github.com/project-chip/certification-tool-cli)
-   [Matter Test Scripts](https://github.com/project-chip/matter-test-scripts)

## Minimum Hardware Requirements

-   SD card 64 GB or mo
-   RaspberryPi 4 or newer with at least 4 GB RAM

## License

The test harness and tools are released under the [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE).

## Install Test Harness on Raspberry Pi

-   Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi turned on and connected to your local network. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md) to setup your Raspberry Pi connection. Remember your IP address since it will be used later.
-   Make sure you have ssh enabled on your Raspberry Pi, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) to enable it.
-   Once you have ssh enabled, run `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@<Raspberry-Pi-IPAddress>` on your local machine.
-   Use `./start.sh` under the project root folder to install dependencies for Test Harness.
-   You should see the below output on your terminal at the end of execution.

```
Creating network "chip-default" with the default driver
Creating network "certification-tool_traefik-public" with the default driver
Creating certification-tool_db_1       ... done
Creating certification-tool_proxy_1    ... done
Creating certification-tool_frontend_1 ... done
Creating certification-tool_backend_1  ... done
```

-   You can now access Test Harness tool at RaspberryPi-IPAddress in your browser.
