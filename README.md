# CSA Certification Tool

## About

With the goal of simplifying development, testing, and certification of devices, the Connectivity Standards Alliance has developed a standardized set of tools as well a test harness that is presently used for Matter certifications.

To learn more about the open-source [Matter SDK](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip), please read more [here](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)

## Project Overview

### Goals

The test tooling, harness, and scripts are developed with the following goals and principles in mind:

**Proven:** The test harness and tools are built with and on top of existing technologies where possible.

**Robust:** The test harness and tools should be reliable and dependable.

**Low Cost:** The test harness and tools should run on low cost and accessible devices.

**Flexible:** The test harness and tools are flexible enough to accommodate deployment in different environments.

**Easy to Use:** The test harness and tools provide a smooth, cohesive, integrated experience.

**Open:** The Projectâ€™s design and technical processes are open and transparent
to the general public, including non-members wherever possible.

# Instructions
